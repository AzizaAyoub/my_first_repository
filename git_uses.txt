// Let's create a new directory called git_basics and add a few files to it.

$ mkdir git_basics
$ cd git_basics
$ echo '# README #' > README.md
$ echo '# LICENSE #' > LICENSE.md

/*
 These two commands, thus, create 2 files, README.md and LICENSE.md, each of which starts with a simple comment (# README #, # LICENSE #).
The files above, README.md and LICENSE.md, are for demonstration purposes only, though they are included in the root directory of many open source projects.

// GitHub uses main as the name of your primary branch
// But git is still uses master default branch
// The best way to accomplish this is to change your default branch name to main:
 
$ git config --global init.defaultBranch main
$ git add --move master main
$ git branch -M main

// with one of these commands you can change you default branch from master to the main.

// We're now ready to create a local repository. On the command line, from within the git_basics directory, type the following:

$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in .../git_basics/.git/

/*
The Initialized message means that git "initialized", or created, a new repository in your current directory.
a .git directory was added to the git_basics directory.
